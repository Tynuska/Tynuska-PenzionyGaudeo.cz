              <h3 class="h3">9)  Complaints procedure and warranties</h3>
              <div class="text mb-10">The buyer is, in principle, obliged to inspect the purchased goods and their accessories upon receipt. If the goods are delivered by the carrier, in particular, the buyer is obliged to check with the carrier the quality of the delivered package and the integrity of the packaging, detect any damage and immediately enter deviations in the shipping list or handover protocol. The moment of the transfer of the risk of damage from the seller to the buyer is the moment of acceptance of the shipment from the carrier. If the buyer fails to inspect the goods or fails to arrange an inspection at the time of passing, the risk of damage can make claims from defects detectable during this inspection only if it proves that the goods already had damage at the time of passing risk.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">Each item is accompanied by a tax document used to enforce the guarantee.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">The seller passes the goods to the buyer in the quality anticipated by § 2161 NOZ,i.e.:<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the good shave properties that buyers have negotiated with the seller, and if the arrangement lacks such characteristics as was described by the seller or expected by the buyer due to the nature of the goods and based on advertising by them<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the goods are fit for the purpose stated by the seller for its use or for which theitem of this kind is usually used<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the goods are the items in the appropriate quantity, amount or weight<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">goods comply with the requirements of the legislation<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">In case the goods do not comply with these requirements when taken over by the buyer, the buyer is entitled to the delivery of new goods without defects, as long as this is not disproportionate to the nature of the matter. If the defect concerns only a component of the item, the buyer may only request the replacement of the compo. If this is not possible, he may withdraw from the contract and demand a full refund of the purchase price. However, if this is disproportionate due to the nature of the defect, in particular, if the defect can be rectified without undue delay, the buyer has the right to rectify the defect free of charge.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">If the buyer does not withdraw from the contract or exercise the right to deliver new goods without defects, replace its component, or repair it, it may require are reasonable discount on the purchase price. The buyer is entitled to an appropriate discount even if the seller can&#x27;t deliver new goods to him without defects, replace its component or repair goods, as well as if the seller fail sto rectify within a reasonable period or if the consumer experiences significant difficulties due to rectification. The seller is not responsible for defects if:<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the defect was on the item at the time of the takeover, and a discount was negotiated on the purchase price for such a defect<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">second-hand goods and the defect corresponds to the level of use or wear that the goods had when the buyer took them over<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the defect was caused by wear and tear caused by normal use or by the nature of the matter (e.g. expiration of lifetime)<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the defect was caused by the buyer and arose from improper use, storage, improper maintenance<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">by the intervention of the buyer or by another person other than the seller or by mechanical damage<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">the defect occurred due to an external event outside the seller&#x27;s influence.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">A complaint is a unilateral legal action by which the buyer identifies the alleged defective characteristic of the goods and, at the same time, communicates what specific claim of liability for defects is being made and the requirement for the method of informing about the handling of the complaint. The buyer is obliged to claim the goods as soon as possible after the defect is detected. Claimed goods must be delivered in packaging that prevents damage. With goods, the buyer presents fundamentally a tax document (copy), the authority for the owner to act.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">If the claim is accepted as legitimate, the buyer is entitled to be reimbursed for the expenses incurred by exercising that right. If the claim is not recognised and the customer insists on repair, the seller is entitled to charge all costs associated with the claim. The goods will be returned to the buyer after the costs have been paid in accordance with the previous sentence. <br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">The seller is obliged to confirm in writing form to the buyer the method of settlement of the complaint and its duration.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">The buyer cannot change the claimed claim without the seller&#x27;s consent. If the goods’ defects subsequently turn out to be irreparable, the buyer may require the delivery of replacement goods if the buyer requests without undue delay after the seller has notified him of this fact.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">Seller&#x27;s liability for defects that are material or non-material breaches of contract applies to defects in goods arising within 24 months of receipt, for defects where quality liability does not apply on the takeover. A defect is considered to be a material breach of contract where the buyer would not have entered into the contract if he had foreseen the defect after the contract. In other cases ,it is a defect which is not a material breach of contract.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">If the defect is a material breach of contract, the buyer of his choice is entitled to the delivery of a new item, repair, reasonable discount or withdrawal (with the right to a full refund of the purchase price). If the defect is a minor breach of contract, the buyer is entitled to have the defect rectified or a reasonable discount.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">The right to delivery of a new impeccable item, part replacement, price discount or withdrawal from the contract has the buyer, regardless of the nature of the defect, if the item cannot be appropriately used for a recurrence of the defect after repair or for a more significant number of defects.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">If the customer requests the delivery of the goods to any place outside the claim location after the claim has ended, the goods are delivered to him at his expense in the same way as when the goods are sold unless there is a legitimate claim.<br></div>
              <div class="text mb-10">If the seller does not rectify the defects within a reasonable additional period or if he notifies before its expiration that they do not remove the defects, the buyer may withdraw from the contract or demand a reasonable discount on the purchase price.<br></div>
              <h3 class="h3">10)  Changes in T&amp;C</h3>
              <div class="text mb-10">These T&amp;Cs may be unilaterally amended and supplemented by the seller with the new wording, always with the effective date of the latest full text appearing on their website.<br></div>
